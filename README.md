React Netflix Clone UI
</h1>

<p align="center">I developed this project with the objective of expanding my knowledge in Javascript, learn more about the functioning of the React framework, API consumption and effects as transitions in CSS.. </p>

<p>The project was divided into 5 combined components:</p>

- [x] Loading - screen displayed while data is being loaded from the api;
- [x] Header - which corresponds to the netflix and user logos and which gains a background when scroll is triggered;
- [x] FeaturedMovie - That corresponds to the presentation of the film highlighted on the main screen;
- [x] MovieRow- Responsible for displaying in carousel format the movie lists according to their category;
- [x] Footer - Corresponds to the website footer;
